# Casas-Power-Prediction

The goal of this project is to see whether we can train a regression model to predict the power usage of a house just by using the output of it's smart sensors, in particular we're going to use the datasets number 7 and 8 from Kyoto, taken from [Casas Wsu project](http://casas.wsu.edu/datasets/).

More details available in the ".ipynb" notebook.
